# Sophia#OriginsAndForm

## Persona

Sophia is a musicologist and a practising musician

## Goal

Sophia is interested in understanding how the composer was influenced, e.g. by which other composers; how the music ‘works’; and why we react to the music in the way we do.  She is interested in parallels between music and language.  

## Scenario  

Sophia is making a detailed analysis of the music itself, e.g. looking at notes in a motif and analysing how the motif changes in the course of the music. This work involves very painstaking manual analysis, in part because the material is not digitized. She is also interested in performance practice, i.e. how the music was played and what conventions were used.    

## Competency questions

CQ1. What parallels are there between the composition of music and the use of language, e.g. in the use of rhetorical delivery?

  * What rhetorical strategies are used in a piece of music?  

CQ2. Why was a piece of music written to be evocative of something, e.g. the call of a cuckoo?

 * What does music evoke?

CQ3. What different motifs exist in a piece of music?

CQ4. What relationships exist in a multi-line piece of music, i.e. over time and between the lines?

CQ5. In early written music, what is left of the preceding unwritten tradition?

 * What are the sources the musician used?
 * What sources, musicians, traditions influenced the musician?

CQ6. How does the corpus of a composer compare with that of other composers, particularly those writing at the same time?

 * What are the similarities? motifs, harmony, texts

CQ7. Can we use a statistical comparison, or a particular ‘thumbprint’ in the music, to identify the composer of a piece of music?

CQ8. When a musical structure, e.g. a motif, is found in two composers, is one copied from the other, or do they come out of a previous tradition?


## Resources

Sophia works with musical scores, written in a notation which is not the same as the modern notation.  She has now translated some of the music to modern notation, using [Dorico](https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr-zyg_iM8AIVAevtCh1MPA4oEAAYASAAEgJBt_D_BwE); this enables her to hear the music.   

Sophia’s work could be helped by:

 * digitalisation of her source material;
 * digital analysis techniques, e.g. statistical analysis, waveform analysis and visualization;
 * manuscript OCR.
